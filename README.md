Hello World✨

I'm a Information Systems student who never saw myself in this field, but is also loving it!❤️  An English language lover who learns very quickly and loves to learn new things. Currently, I'm learning web development, but I also know a little bit about Java☕ and Python🐍. 
Oh! And last but not least: a Jesus lover!
